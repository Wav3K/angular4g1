## Installation ⚙️

To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AngularTODO4g1.git
cd AngularTODO4g1
npm install
```

## Development Server 🚀

To run the application in a development environment, execute:

```bash
ng serve
```

Then, navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you make changes to any of the source files.

## Code Scaffolding 🛠️

To generate a new component or other Angular constructs, use the following command:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

You can also generate directives, pipes, services, classes, guards, interfaces, enums, or modules using:

```bash
ng generate <type> <name>
```

Replace `<type>` with `directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module` and `<name>` with your desired name.

## Building the Project 🏗️

To create a production build of the project, run:

```bash
ng build
```

The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running Unit Tests 🧪

To execute unit tests, use:

```bash
ng test
```

This command runs the tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running End-to-End Tests 🔍

For end-to-end testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Note: You may need to add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities before using this command.
